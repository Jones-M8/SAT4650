The report seemed to narrow chemical process safety to monitoring only, rather than including the aspect of structure and responsive action (automated in some cases). For instance, sensor failures were understated as confidence issues, despite the fact that in real reactor environments they typically trigger immediate safety interlocks to prevent catastrophic outcomes. The inclusion of energy inefficiencies under "exceeded" safety did not show thorough distinction between economic performance and true process hazards. The aforementioned, risks alarm fatigue, where critical safety alerts are obscured by non-urgent operational data. Overall, the report over relied on operator intervention and underestimated the role of Safety Instrumented Systems designed to eliminate human error during rapid, high-risk events.
