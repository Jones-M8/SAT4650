MTU Flex is built on Michigan Tech's institutional agility. It will allow us to make adjustments as required with the least amount of disruption to students, faculty, and staff. This helps ensure continuity of education, teaching, research, and workflow while continuing to prioritize the health and well-being of the Michigan Tech community. MTU Flex also means the University will be ready to respond to disruptions caused by COVID-19, such as financial changes, a need to care for ill relatives or roommates, or a lack of reliable internet. If your individual situation changes, stay in touch, and keep the University aware of the challenges you're facing.
